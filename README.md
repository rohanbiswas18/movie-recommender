# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System (Python)

A **Python-based Movie Recommendation System** that suggests movies based on the user’s interests, previous ratings, or movie similarity.  
The system can work in two ways:

1. **Content-Based Filtering** → Recommends movies similar to a selected movie by comparing attributes like genre, cast, or keywords.
2. **Collaborative Filtering** → Recommends movies liked by users with similar tastes, based on rating patterns.

This project is ideal for learning **data science concepts** like data cleaning, similarity measures, and recommendation algorithms.

## 📌 Features
- 🔍 **Personalized Recommendations** — Suggests movies based on your preferences.
- 🧠 **Two Recommendation Modes** — Content-based and collaborative filtering.
- 📊 **Dataset-Friendly** — Works with movie datasets like TMDB or IMDB.
- ⚡ **Efficient Similarity Search** — Uses cosine similarity or Pearson correlation.
- 🎯 **Beginner-Friendly Code** — Easy to read and modify for your own use.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x** — Programming language.
- **Pandas** — Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy** — Numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn** — Similarity algorithms (Cosine Similarity, Nearest Neighbors).
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** — Data visualization (optional for graphs).
